            <p>Now, we could spend some time downloading many images from something like
                Google image search, but in this instance we have a shortcut: a standard collection of
                images used to train neural networks, called ImageNet. It contains more than 14 mil‐
                lion images and 20,000 image categories. It’s the standard that all image classifiers
                judge themselves against. So I take images from there, though feel free to download
                other ones yourself if you prefer.</p>

            <p>Along with the data, PyTorch needs a way to determine what is a cat and what is a
fish. That’s easy enough for us, but it’s somewhat harder for the computer (which is
why we are building the program in the first place!). We use a label attached to the
data, and training in this manner is called supervised learning. (When you don’t have
access to any labels, you have to use, perhaps unsurprisingly, unsupervised learning
methods for training.)
