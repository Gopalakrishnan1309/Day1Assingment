            <p>Now, we could spend some time downloading many images from something like
                Google image search, but in this instance we have a shortcut: a standard collection of
                images used to train neural networks, called ImageNet. It contains more than 14 mil‐
                lion images and 20,000 image categories. It’s the standard that all image classifiers
                judge themselves against. So I take images from there, though feel free to download
                other ones yourself if you prefer.</p>

            <p>Along with the data, PyTorch needs a way to determine what is a cat and what is a
fish. That’s easy enough for us, but it’s somewhat harder for the computer (which is
why we are building the program in the first place!). We use a label attached to the
data, and training in this manner is called supervised learning. (When you don’t have
access to any labels, you have to use, perhaps unsurprisingly, unsupervised learning
methods for training.)

<p> Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph</p>
